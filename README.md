# ScrapyardCataclysm
A mod for the game Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Items inspired by historical and modern day DIYers.

## New Weapons:

Gatling Airbow - Does damage on par with a heavy crossbow, using air pressure instead of elasticity. Has a rotating set of 8 "barrels" that the arrows slide onto, making it look like an antique pattern gatling gun. Pressure to launch the bolts is provided by a tiny air pump, that is powered by a small crank. Takes a very long time to reload because of the pressurization, and the air pump is very loud while doing so.

Frisbee - Recipe added.

Frisbee Spiker - A frisbee with 8 screws sticking out around the rim. Very pointy, but still not heavy enough to do much damage. Also has zapper and burner varieties.

Foam Dart Revolver - A 6 shot toy pistol that shoots harmless foam darts.

Eternal L-stick - An l-stick with an rtg from a coffeepot duct taped to it. It's heavy and leaks radioactive goo if damaged, but it lights up a decent area forever.

Eternal L-Polearms - An eternal l-stick with the head of a sturdy polearm attached. The added weight (+4.5 kilos) makes the polearms a bit more unweildy, but definitely adds some punch. Halberd and Ji varieties.

## New Ammo:

Pneumatic Bolt - An arrow with the nock cut off and weight added behind the tip. Simple, broadhead, bodkin, small game, and carbon fiber varieties.

Foam Dart - A tiny foam dart with a rubber tip. Standard, nail tip, razor tip, and bearing tip varieties.
