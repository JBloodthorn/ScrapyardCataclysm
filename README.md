# ScrapyardCataclysm
A mod for the game Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Items inspired by historical and modern day DIYers.

New Weapons:
Gatling Airbow - Does damage equal to a heavy crossbow, but is miniaturized and modernized. Has a rotating set of 8 "barrels" like an antique pattern gatling gun. Powered by a tiny air pump that is in turn recharged via a small crank. Takes a very long time to reload, and the pump is very loud while doing so. Custom ammunition crafted from existing crossbow bolts is planned, but it uses regular bolts for now.
