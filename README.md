# ScrapyardCataclysm
A mod for the game Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Items inspired by historical and modern day DIYers.

## New Weapons:

Gatling Airbow - Does damage equal to a heavy crossbow, but is miniaturized and modernized. Has a rotating set of 8 "barrels" that the arrows slide onto, making it look like an antique pattern gatling gun. Pressure to launch the bolts is provided by a tiny air pump, that is powered by a small crank. Takes a very long time to reload because of the pressurization, and the air pump is very loud while doing so. The ammo it uses are heavy bolts, which are really just arrows with the nock cut off and weight added behind the head.

Frisbee - Recipe added.

Frisbee Spiker - A frisbee with 8 screws sticking out around the rim. Very pointy, but still not heavy enough to do much damage.

Frisbee Zapper - A frisbee spiker with a tazer ineffectively wired to the spikes. Doesn't do much more than tingle.
